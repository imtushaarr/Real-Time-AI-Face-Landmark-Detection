# Real-Time AI Face Landmark Detection

## Overview

The **Real-Time AI Face Landmark Detection** project demonstrates real-time facial landmark detection using TensorFlow.js and React. This project utilizes TensorFlow.js's FaceMesh model to identify and visualize facial landmarks in a live video stream from a webcam. The application is built using React and leverages the `react-webcam` library for video capture.

## Features

- **Real-Time Face Detection:** Uses TensorFlow.js FaceMesh model to detect facial landmarks in real-time.
- **Live Webcam Feed:** Captures live video feed from the user's webcam.
- **Facial Landmark Visualization:** Draws facial landmarks and mesh on the canvas overlaying the webcam feed.
- **Optimized for Performance:** Real-time detection with efficient rendering for smooth user experience.

## Technologies Used

- **React:** For building the user interface.
- **TensorFlow.js:** For face landmark detection with the FaceMesh model.
- **react-webcam:** For capturing live video feed from the user's webcam.
- **JavaScript:** For application logic and interactivity.

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RealTimeAIFaceLandmarkDetection.git
   ```
2. **Navigate to the Project Directory:**
   ```bash
   cd RealTimeAIFaceLandmarkDetection/facemesh
   ```
3. **Install Dependencies:**
   ```bash
    npm install
   ```
This will start the application on http://localhost:3000 by default.

## Usage

**To use the application:**

1.	Ensure you have a working webcam connected to your computer.
2.	Open the application in your browser.
3.	The application will request permission to access your webcam.
4.	Once permission is granted, you will see the live video feed with facial landmarks and mesh drawn on it in real-time.
